My first objective programming project- The Guessing Game. The user has n money. They can bet x money on one of the symbols "-.-", "@.@", "[*]", "^J^", "o~~". The symbol is being randomly drawn from the text file. If the user guesses right, they receive twice the money they bet. If the user guesses wrong they lose the amount of money they bet. Game ends if the user loses all the money or decides to resign.
