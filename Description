Objective programming project- The Guessing Game. The user has n money. Then he can bet x money on one of the symbols "(o)", "@.@", "[*]", "^J^", "o~~". One of the symbols is being chosen randomly from the text file. If the user guessed right he receives 2x money and has n+2x money now. If the user guessed wrong he loses x money and now has n-2 money. Game ends if the user loses all his money or if he choose to resign.
